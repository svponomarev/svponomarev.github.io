Hi, my name is Sviatoslav Ponomarev, Iâ€™m a computer vision engineer with over 10 years of experience on different R&D projects related with 2D/3D image matching, synthetic data generation and objects classification. I am currently working for Ventra Employment at Huawei department as a Senior Software Engineer on SRC Media Team.

I enjoy exploring the applications of machine learning and image processing in other areas of human life, such as arts, sports or medicine. I have worked with a range of different languages and frameworks and I am always looking for opportunities to work with something new. The things that I currently have the most experience working with are C++, Python, OpenCV, PCL and OpenGL.
